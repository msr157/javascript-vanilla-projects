All theses folder contains same html and css codes Only difference is in the js code.

As you can see the code is for FORM and validation,
In folder 1, the validation method is different and its not scalable and code is not clean.

In folder 2, the code is scalable and validation is done with good practice.

In folder 3, the code is scalable and validation is done with good practice.
